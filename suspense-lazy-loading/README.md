Lazy Loading using React Suspense
=================================

This example shows how to lazy load pages using React Suspense. This is done in shell.js - it pulls in the functionality of view mapping (which is generally handled by `RouterView`) to load all pages lazily.

Quick Start
-----------
```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

Now point your browser to http://localhost:3000/.
