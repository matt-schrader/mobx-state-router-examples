Animated Page Transitions
=========================

This example shows how to animate page transitions using mobx-state-router. We are using the [react-transition-group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) library for page animations. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53Y8q-SgLF0) to understand the basics.

The heart of the implementation is in `shell.js`:

```
render() {
    ...
    const routeName = routerStore.routerState.routeName;
    const view = viewMap[routeName];

    return (
        <TransitionGroup component={null}>
            <CSSTransition
                key={routerStore.routerState.routeName}
                timeout={250}
                classNames="fade"
            >
                {view}
            </CSSTransition>
        </TransitionGroup>
    );
}
```

Here we determine the view that should be rendered based on the router's state. The view is wrapped in `TransitionGroup`. Whenever the route changes and a new view is rendered, the `TransitionGroup` orchestrates a transition between the old view and the new view.

Quick Start
-----------
```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
